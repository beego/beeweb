			    <h1>Why Beego?</h1>
			    <p>
			    	I used to use CI in PHP and tornado in Python, there are both lightweight, so they has following advantages:
			    	<ul>
			    		<li>Save time for handling general problems, I only need to care about logic part.</li>
			    		<li>Learn more about languages by studying their source code, it's not hard to read and understand them because they are both lightweight frameworks.</li>
			    		<li>It's quite easy to make secondary development of these frameworks for specific purposes.</li>
			    	</ul>
					Those reasons are my original intention of implementing Beego, and used two chapters in my book to introduce and design this lightweight web framework in Go. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/astaxie/beego/blob/master/docs/en/Why.md">read more -&gt;</a>

					<h2>Synchronous</h2>
					<p>
						Beego uses <a target="_blank" href="http://gowalker.org/net/http">Go HTTP server</a> underlying to serve each request in its own <a target="_blank" href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#goroutines">goroutine</a> and logic processes without affecting others. Low pay of goroutines gives you ability to build high-concurrency web applications, like RESTful API services.
					</p>
			    </div>

				<div class="span4">
					<h2>Stateless</h2>
					<p>
						Beego provides <a href="/docs/Controllers_Session">session</a> support in memory, files, Redis or MySQL and <a href="/docs/Controllers_Cache">cache</a> support in memory, Redis or Memcache. For simple usage, Beego also has thread-safe map for storing temporary data during the runtime.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="span4">
					<h2>Free & Open</h2>
					<p>
						Beego gives developers freedom to replace or integrate default modules with customized implementations. You are also able to integrate third-party applications with customized <a href="http://gowalker.org/net/http#Handler">http.Handler</a>(router).
					</p>

			    <h1>Features</h1>
			    <p>
			    	Beego is an open-source, high-performance web framework for the Go programming language. This web framework has been already used for building web servers and tools in SNDA's CDN system.

					<h2>Hot Compile</h2>
					<p>
						Edit, save, and refresh. <a href="/docs/Reference_BeeTool">Bee</a> tool compiles your code and templates when you're coding. Developers should put more focus on how to make things work not wait.
					</p>

				<div class="span4">
					<h2>Simple & Powerful</h2>
					<p>
						Including <a href="/docs/Controllers_Routing">intelligent routing</a>, <a href="/docs/Controllers_Parameters">parameters</a> <a href="/docs/Controllers_Filters">filtering</a>, <a href="/docs/Views_Templates">templating</a>, <a href="/docs/Controllers_Cache">caching</a>, <a href="/docs/Controllers_Validation">validation</a>, <a href="/docs/Controllers_Session">session</a>, <a href="/docs/Controllers_Logging">logging</a>, <a href="/docs/Operational_HotUpgrade">hot upgrade</a>, <a href="/docs/Controllers_SafeMap">safe map</a>, and even <a href="/docs/Controllers_IntegrateApp">integrated third-party applications</a>. All of these just need few lines of code.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="span4">
					<h2>High Performance</h2>
					<p>
						Beego builds on top of the Go HTTP server, which was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6">recently benchmarked</a> to serve <b>three to ten times</b> as many requests as Rails across a variety of loads.
